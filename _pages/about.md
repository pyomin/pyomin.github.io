Hello, I am Pyomin Hong. I received my master’s degree in Computer Engineering from Hongik University, Seoul in February 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/younkyul'>Youn Kyu Lee</a> and Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/tae-hyung-kim/'>Tae Hyung Kim</a>. My master’s research focused on deep learning for biometric systems at the intersection of computer vision and AI security.

Following graduation, I had the privilege of continuing my research under the guidance of Prof. <a href='https://albert-no.github.io'>Albert No</a>. During this period, I expanded my research into secure generative modeling and language model security.

I am broadly interested in **Trustworthy AI**. My research spans **(i)** **robust and secure AI** under adversarial settings, **(ii)** **media integrity analysis** such as liveness and deepfake detection, and **(iii)** **security and reliability** for generative models.
