Hello, I am Pyomin Hong. I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in computer engineering at Hongik University, Seoul. Previously, I earned my bachelor’s degree in information security from Seoul Women’s University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

I am dedicated to exploring the impact of deep learning models and theories on our lives, particularly in areas like biometric systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and AI security. Currently, I am engaged in research at <a href='https://ais.hongik.ac.kr'>AISLab</a> where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/taekim/'>Tae Hyung Kim</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/younkyul'>Youn Kyu Lee.</a>
