@INPROCEEDINGS{CentralPoint,
  abstract={To minimize security threats using fake fingerprints, various CNN-based fingerprint liveness detection methods have been proposed. However, since existing methods mainly employ a random crop method, key information of target fingerprint may be overlooked during the training process, which may lead to decreased detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new fingerprint liveness detection method based on central point analysis of fingerprints. The proposed method measures a central point of target fingerprint, extracts the crops with different sizes based on the central point, and fuses the liveness scores inferred from each crop-size model. As a result of validating our method using real datasets, it was confirmed that our method effectively detects fake fingerprints compared to existing methods.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{Adv2Adv,
  abstract={A number of denoising-based methods have been proposed to defend against adversarial fingerprint attacks. However, these methods inherently rely on having a clean image that corresponds to each adversarial fingerprint image. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising-based defense method without the need for clean fingerprint images. Our approach leverages a Noise2Noise mechanism, which performs denoising based on the noisy dataset. This enables us to effectively eliminate any adversarial noise that may be embedded in fingerprint images without training on clean fingerprint images. The experimental results on real-world datasets confirm that our method is robust against untrained adversarial fingerprint attacks while outperforming existing methods.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{Purification,
  abstract={Various methods have been proposed to defend face identification systems against adversarial attacks by eliminating adversarial perturbations from target face images. However, it is challenging to eliminate such perturbations while preserving the crucial facial features within the images. In this paper, we propose a novel purification method for an effective defense against adversarial attacks on target face images. Our method incorporates a two-stage image restoration utilizing diffusion, consisting of sequential super-resolution-based image restoration followed by colorization-based image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in eliminating perturbations while preserving the identity of the facial features.},

  @ARTICLE{diprecon,
  abstract={Recently, deep learning-based biometric authentication systems, especially fingerprint authentication, have been used widely in real-world. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which prevent deep learning models from distinguishing input data properly. To solve these problems, various defense methods have been proposed, especially utilizing denoising mechanisms, but they provided limited defense performance. In this study, we proposed a new defense method against adversarial fingerprint attacks. To ensure defense performance, we have introduced Deep Image Prior mechanism which has superior performance in image reconstruction without prior training and a large amount of dataset. The proposed method aims to remove adversarial perturbations of the input fingerprint image and reconstruct it close to the original fingerprint image by adapting Deep Image Prior. Our method has achieved robust defense performance against various types of adversarial fingerprint attacks across different datasets, encompassing variations in sensors, shapes, and materials of fingerprint images. Furthermore, our method has demonstrated that it is superior to other image reconstruction methods.},

@article{velcro,
  abstract={The development and deployment of deep learning models are currently limited to expert developers due to the requirement for programming expertise, posing challenges for non-expert or inexperienced developers. In this paper, we present VELCRO, a visual-based programming tool that enables intuitive construction, modification, analysis, and generation of deep learning models for both expert and non-expert developers. VELCRO allows users to understand and modify complex architectures of deep learning models using architecture abstraction, and verify architectures through automated architecture validation. Finally, users can convert the user-configured architecture into deep learning code and deploy it in target environments.},
