  abstract={To address the security threats posed by highly realistic deepfakes, various deepfake detection methods have been proposed. In particular, texture features resulting from the post-processing steps in deepfake generation, such as color correction and edge smoothing have been widely utilized in deepfake detection methods. However their detection method is limited against advanced image synthesis mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel deepfake detection method based on texture features, an Image Waveform. Our proposed method converts the pixel values of an image into an Image Waveform to enhance texture features and utilizes two-stream CNN to maximize deepfake detection performance by effectively leveraging the features of the original image. Experimental results of real-world deepfake dataset, confirmed that our proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy compared to existing texture feature-based detection methods.},

@ARTICLE{AttentionMap,
  abstract={To counter the security threats posed by presentation attacks on fingerprint authentication systems, various deep learning-based fingerprint liveness detection methods have been proposed. However, existing methods typically require significant computing resources or lengthy detection times to achieve high accuracy, which can limit their use in resource-constrained environments such as on-device applications. In this paper, we propose a novel fingerprint liveness detection method that utilizes a Multi-head Self-Attention mechanism. By focusing on important regions of fingerprint images, our proposed method maximizes detection accuracy while simultaneously minimizing both model size and detection time. Our evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that our proposed method achieves detection accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while requiring the smallest model size and the least detection time, confirming that our proposed method is the most efficient liveness detection method available.},

@ARTICLE{Orthogonal,
  author={Yoon, Jung Won and Yook, Hyun Jun and Hong, Pyo Min and Lee, Youn Kyu and Kim, Tae Hyung},
  abstract={A large amount of data collected from sensors exhibits Gaussian noise characteristics, making denoising and related processing critical. However, data scarcity can lead to overfitting, posing challenges in training deep learning-based denoising methods. While various data augmentation methods have been proposed, they do not provide a means to augment original data to large-scale data while preserving the exact noise distribution. To address this, we introduce a novel data augmentation method for data with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Our method is based on two main premises: first, orthogonal transforms preserve the probability distribution of AWGN; second, the signals we aim to recover generally exhibit smooth characteristics, unlike noise. Building on these premises, we propose adaptive smoothnesspromoting orthogonal transforms for augmenting limited existing data. We evaluated the proposed method in Gaussian denoising tasks with limited data and confirmed that it achieves substantial improvement in deep learning model performance, comparable to those obtained with sufficient data.},

@ARTICLE{RiskAnalysis,
  abstract={Recent threats to deep learning-based biometric authentication systems stem from adversarial attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in deep learning models. While existing studies extensively analyze the risk of such attacks, they primarily focus on isolated modules (e.g., liveness detectors or identity matchers) or specific adversarial attack types (e.g., evasion and poisoning attacks). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that comprehensively assesses the risk of adversarial attacks by simulating multiple scenarios within biometric authentication systems. We identify the surfaces susceptible to adversarial attacks within these systems and devise scenarios that reflect the dependencies between modules. Moreover, we establish evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess the risk involved. Through a case study conducted on a real-world face recognition system, we successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach facilitates the systematic evaluation of the security of target biometric authentication systems against adversarial attacks. Ultimately, it enables the establishment of robust and proactive defense mechanisms.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{Adv2Adv,
  abstract={A number of denoising-based methods have been proposed to defend against adversarial fingerprint attacks. However, these methods inherently rely on having a clean image that corresponds to each adversarial fingerprint image. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising-based defense method without the need for clean fingerprint images. Our approach leverages a Noise2Noise mechanism, which performs denoising based on the noisy dataset. This enables us to effectively eliminate any adversarial noise that may be embedded in fingerprint images without training on clean fingerprint images. The experimental results on real-world datasets confirm that our method is robust against untrained adversarial fingerprint attacks while outperforming existing methods.},

However, it is challenging to eliminate such perturbations while preserving the crucial facial features within the images. In this paper, we propose a novel purification method for an effective defense against adversarial attacks on target face images. Our method incorporates a two-stage image restoration utilizing diffusion, consisting of sequential super-resolution-based image restoration followed by colorization-based image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in eliminating perturbations while preserving the identity of the facial features.},

  @ARTICLE{DipRecon,
  abstract={Recently, deep learning-based biometric authentication systems, especially fingerprint authentication, have been used widely in real-world. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which prevent deep learning models from distinguishing input data properly. To solve these problems, various defense methods have been proposed, especially utilizing denoising mechanisms, but they provided limited defense performance. In this study, we proposed a new defense method against adversarial fingerprint attacks. To ensure defense performance, we have introduced Deep Image Prior mechanism which has superior performance in image reconstruction without prior training and a large amount of dataset. The proposed method aims to remove adversarial perturbations of the input fingerprint image and reconstruct it close to the original fingerprint image by adapting Deep Image Prior. Our method has achieved robust defense performance against various types of adversarial fingerprint attacks across different datasets, encompassing variations in sensors, shapes, and materials of fingerprint images. Furthermore, our method has demonstrated that it is superior to other image reconstruction methods.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{CentralPoint,
  abstract={To minimize security threats using fake fingerprints, various CNN-based fingerprint liveness detection methods have been proposed. However, since existing methods mainly employ a random crop method, key information of target fingerprint may be overlooked during the training process, which may lead to decreased detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new fingerprint liveness detection method based on central point analysis of fingerprints. The proposed method measures a central point of target fingerprint, extracts the crops with different sizes based on the central point, and fuses the liveness scores inferred from each crop-size model. As a result of validating our method using real datasets, it was confirmed that our method effectively detects fake fingerprints compared to existing methods.},
